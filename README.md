# VoiceDetectionModel_2018
Voice detection model I used during my work for Cacophony.org.nz.

This is accompanied by the report I created which can be found here:

This model is a clone of the work done by Yong Xu:

Please note that I have put little work into making this repo useable for others. But if you are interested please don't hesitate to send me an email and I'll be glad to help.
